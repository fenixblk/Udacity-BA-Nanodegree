# Welcome to my Portfolio for Udacity's Business Analyst Nanodegree!

Project One: Analyze NYSE Data
In this project, you will work with a New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) dataset that contains fundamental financial data for 500 companies. You will use spreadsheets to analyze and summarize the data using statistics and data visualizations. You will communicate the key findings in a professional manner. You will also design a dashboard that calculates the financial metrics and auto populates the income statement for each company using data validation and advanced lookup tools within Excel. You will then forecast financial metrics within the Income Statement, based on three scenarios with distinct assumptions for a company of your choice from the NYSE dataset.

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
➔ Calculate summary statistics using spreadsheets.
➔ Create data visualizations using spreadsheets.
➔ Ask questions and answer them using data.
➔ Work with real-world data that has missing and incorrect values.
➔ Calculate key business metrics in financial analysis and interpret values.
➔ Forecast financial metrics using scenario analysis.
